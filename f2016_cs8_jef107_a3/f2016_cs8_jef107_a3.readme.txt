In the main program, the first thing I did was open the master file so that I could extract the file names inside that needed to 
be processed. I used a for loop to read through and process the three files given inside the master file. Inside of the 
loop, I used the processFile function to process each of the files inside the master file and extract info such as 
names, distances, and the total number of times a certain participant appeared in the files altogether. 
After using the processFile function, I then accumulated the total distance and total lines in all the files.

The next section of the main program pertains to the formatting of the output. 
The max and the min function were used to find the maximum and minimum distance. 
Once the distances were determined, their position in the list was determined in order to link these distances back to the name. 


In the last section of the program, I created an output file that would add the accumulated total distance of each 
participant as well as the times they appeared in the files. When the output file was created, the program is designed 
to see if a name already exist in the list. If the name exists, then the program updates the record with the new accumulated
distance and count number. If the name doesnâ€™t exist, then the name, distance and count number are all added to the list. Once
I have all the data accumulated in my memory list, now I can report on the details of the list such as the total distance each 
person ran as well as the number of times they appeared in the file.
