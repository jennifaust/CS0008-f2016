  I first asked the user their preferred system of units and wrote a series of if-else statements based on their response. The user had 
to either input 1 or 2 for USC or metric system respectively.  I decided to first write the conditions for users who prefer the USC system. 
If the user entered 1, indicating that their desired system was USC, I then followed with asking them how many miles they drove as well as
the number of gallons they used. Based on their input, I then converted those numbers to the metric units of kilometers and liters. I then
calculated the fuel consumption first in USC units and then calculated fuel consumption using metric units, since both the USC and metric
values of distance and gas are defined at this point. After this, I formatted and printed the information provided that was provided by
the user and the information calculated with the program. I then wrote a series of nested if statements that defined the ranges of 
fuel consumption and printed the ratings for each. The fuel consumption rating had to be the last block under the first if statement
because it is printed last. These are all the blocks under the first if statement for USC users.
  If the user chose the metric system, they would enter the number 2. This was the elif statement following the first if statement. I then
repeated all the steps as I did with USC users, except I switched everything for metric users. So instead of asking the user how many miles
and gallons of gas they used, I instead asked the user how many kilometers and liters of gas they used. Instead of converting from USC to 
metric, I converted from metric to USC. I then calculated the fuel consumption in USC units and metric units except using the different
variables that I defined for the distance and gas. Following this, I printed and formatted all the information provided by the user and
the information calculated by the program. Under the printed and formatted code, I inserted the consumption rating. 
  For the last line of code, I added an else statement that prompted the user to enter either a 1 or a 2 for USC or metric, since the
program would not run if either a 1 or 2 was not entered.
