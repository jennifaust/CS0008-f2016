# Description:
# A car's miles-per-gallon (MPG) can be calculated with the following formula:
#       MPG = Miles driven Gallons of gas used
# Write a program that asks the user for the number of miles driven and the gallons
# of gas used. It should calculate the car's MPG and display the result.
# Python, Chapter 2, exercise 7
# Notes: N/A

number_of_miles = int(input("How many miles did you drive?"))
gallons_of_gas = int(input("How many gallons of gas did you use?"))

MPG = number_of_miles*gallons_of_gas

print("Your car's MPG is", MPG)
