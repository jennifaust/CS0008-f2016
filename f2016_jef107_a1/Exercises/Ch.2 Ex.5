# Description:
# Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that
# a car travels down the interstate can be calculated with the
# following formula:
# Distance = Speed * Time
# A car is traveling at 90Km/h. Write a program that displays the
# following:
#   - the distance the car will travel in 6 hours
#   - the distance the car will travel in 10 hours
#   - the distance the car will travel in 15 hours
#   - the distance the car will travel in 2 hours and 25 minutes
# Python, Chapter 2, exercise 5
# Notes: N/A

# Defining Speed variable

Speed = 90

# Displaying for 6 hours
Time = 6
Distance = Speed*Time
print("The distance the car will travel in 6 hours is", Distance)

# Displaying for 10 hours
Time1 = 10
Distance1 = Speed*Time1
print("The distance the car will travel in 6 hours is", Distance1)

# Displaying for 15 hours
Time2 = 15
Distance2 = Speed*Time2
print("The distance the car will travel in 6 hours is", Distance2)

# Displaying for 2 hours and 25 minutes
Time3 = 2.25
Distance3 = Speed*Time3
print("The distance the car will travel in 2 hours and 25 minutes is", Distance3)
