# Description:
# A cookie recipe calls for the following ingredients:
#       - 1.5 cups of sugar
#       - 1 cup of butter
#       - 2.75 cups of flour
# The recipe produces 48 cookies with this amount of the ingredients. Write a program that
# asks the user how many cookies he or she wants to make, and then displays the number of cups of each
# ingredient needed for the specified number of cookies.
# Notes: N/A

# Asking the user how many cookies ze would like to make
amount_of_cookies = int(input("How many cookies would you like to make?"))

# Calculating amount of ingredients needed
cups_of_sugar = (amount_of_cookies/48)*1.5
cups_of_butter = (amount_of_cookies/48)*1
cups_of_flour = (amount_of_cookies/48)*2.75

# Displaying
print("The cups of sugar you need for this amount is", cups_of_sugar)
print("The cups of butter you need for this amount is", cups_of_butter)
print("The cups of flour you need for this amount is", cups_of_flour)
