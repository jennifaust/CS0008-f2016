# The program runs.

# This program extracts the names and distances from the files listed in the Master file, using the
# DataFile class. The class contains methods that extract the required data components to properly
# process the file.
#
#
# The last section of this program creates an output file that adds the accumulated
# total distance of each participant as well as the times they appeared in the files.
# If the name of a participant already exists, then the program updates the record
# with the new accumulated distance and count number. If the name doesn't exist, then
# the name, distance and count number are all added to the list. After this is done
# I can now report of the details of the list such as the total distance each
# person ran as well as the number of times they appeared in the file.
